# High Dimensional and Deep Learning

## Presentation :

The main theme of the course is learning methods, especially deep neural networks, for  processing  high dimensional  data, such as signals or images. We will cover the following topics:

 
* Neural networks and introduction to deep learning: definition of neural networks, activation functions, multilayer perceptron, backpropagation algorithms, optimization algorithms, regularization. <br/>
**Application** : [Implementation of a mlp with one layer with `Numpy`](https://github.com/wikistat/High-Dimensional-Deep-Learning/tree/master/BackPropagation)


* Convolutional neural networks: convolutional layer, pooling, dropout, convolutional network architectures (ResNet, Inception), transfer learning and fine tuning, applications for image or signal classification, applications for objects localization and detection. <br/>
**Application 1** : [Image classification on *MNIST* and *CatsVsDogs* data with `Tensorflow`](https://github.com/wikistat/High-Dimensional-Deep-Learning/tree/master/ImageClassification) <br/>
**Application 2** : [Objects localization and detection through CNNs](https://github.com/wikistat/High-Dimensional-Deep-Learning/tree/master/VisionCNN)

* Encoder-decoder, Variational auto-encoder, Generative adversarial networks

* Functional decomposition on splines, Fourier or wavelets bases: cubic splines, penalized least squares criterion, Fourier basis, wavelet bases, applications to nonparametric regression, linear estimators and nonlinear estimators by thresholding, links with the LASSO method.

* Anomaly detection for functional data: One Class SVM, Random Forest, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor. Applications to  anomaly detection in functional data.
 
* Recurrent Neural Networks <br/>
**Application** : [Sentiment analysis through Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/wikistat/High-Dimensional-Deep-Learning/tree/master/RNN)

## Organisation : 

* Lectures : 9 H .

* Practical works : 28 H applications on real data sets with Python's libraries Scikit Learn and Keras -Tensorflow. 


## Evaluation

* written exam (50 %) - 

* project (oral presentation 25%  + notebook (25%) <br>The main objective of this project is to apply the knowledge you acquired during this course by:

    * Selecting a deep learning algorithm you haven't seen in this course.
    * Explaining how this algorithm works both in a notebook and an oral presentation. The notebook must explain in details how the method principles and the experimental procedure 
    * Apply this algorithm on a different dataset and discuss on the obtained results (notebook and oral presentation).

You can choose a deep learning algorithm among the following list. <br>
This list is not exhaustive and you can suggest other algorithms (that's actually a good idea). <br>
Also, the code proposed on those examples are not necessarily the official code nor the one proposed by the authors. <br>
